## First Meeting

Starting date : November 2nd

Here are the tasks to do regarding the first work iteration :
- Makefile
- Dockerfiles
- Docker-compose
- set up the database (Prisma)
- set up the BE + FE

@mhahn and @wollio will work on their respective branches in order to set up the fundamentals of the project.


Suggestions from @wollio:
- using Typescript in strict mode initially -> this way we'll learn to code in typescript properly. And it's pretty difficult to switch on the fly as this would result in code rewriting.
- using npm or yarn doesn't matter, but I am usually using npm
